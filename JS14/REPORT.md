## 14.2.2 Question's Answer
1. A Binary Search Tree (BST) keeps data sorted by placing smaller values on the left and larger ones on the right, making searching efficient.
2. Each node uses left and right to point to its child nodes, and the root is the starting point of all tree operations.
3. If the tree is empty, the first node added becomes the root of the BST.
4. New nodes are placed by comparing IPK values and moving left or right until the right spot is found.
5. To delete a node with two children, replace it with the smallest node from its right subtree (in-order successor) and update connections.

## 14.3.2 Question's Answer
1. data is an array of Student19 objects, and idxLast shows the index of the last filled data.
2. It fills the binary tree array with student data and updates the last index.
3. In-order traversal visits left child, root, then right child to print students in sorted order.
4. The left child of index 2 is at index 5, and the right child is at index 6.
5. An idxLast value of 6 means there are 7 students in the array (from index 0 to 6).
6. In a binary tree array, left child is at 2*i + 1 and right child is at 2*i + 2.
